## Purpose
There are generally three categories of ebuilds in this repository:
1. Software that has not been on Gentoo's repos or Layman before
2. Software that I want to manually update as fast as possible
3. Software that I want to preserve should the repo I found it on be taken down

In the third case, every effort is made to note the original repository.
